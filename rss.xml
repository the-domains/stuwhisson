            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Report: Upgraded PlayStation 4 codenamed 'Neo,' includes upgraded GPU and processor</h1><p>Looks like it's another thing I need to save up for! All this gadgetry is getting tiring. Only had the PS4 since launch for a few years now, perhaps three, but I will know, knowing how I am with gadgets, that I will need this.... correction, I don't need it, I want it and being that it's a PS4 (Neo) and something better than what I already have, I will by default "Need it!"</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/3730103fff7468f264ad414237750181b220725a.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Walking Dead: Michonne's finale launches next week</h1><p>I've loved what Telltale Games have managed to do with the Walking Dead series. I'm currently having to play this on my mobile, as my laptop is a bit slow with it, but looking forward to finishing this.... actually, come to think of it, I'm travelling back to the UK a week on Monday. I think I've just found out what I will do for the long, tiring, cramped and dirty 20 hour journey back!</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/5dd8720650a19d4564700a00777e3c443e203956.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A subscription for quality bathroom basics.</h1><p>I'm a sucker for bathroom stuff for dudes! In fact I'm a huge fan of these guys. Great products, simple, convenient, great smelling, natural and delivered to your door - plus they're a good price. In fact, I loved the company that much, I'm doing some work for them to help me tide over whilst I am working on my degree. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/308a312ba67505879712927e58d0824a65b722a6.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Society of Sound</h1><p>I've been a big fan of alternative download sites, especially those that are high resolution and support lesser known upcoming acts. Society of Sound has been around for some time, and it's a reasonable price, plus an alternative model that say Spotify. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/5bd55df16d30577155e285c13b382648849a64cb.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>DIME: Online Music Education</h1><p>Every now and again I get asked where I study my degree at. Dime-Online is the place and their courses are pretty cool. There's a good range for the budding songwriter like me, to the drummer, guitarist or even the business minded. The degrees are underwritten by Falmouth University in the UK.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/3a237173dad735dd2144506eacff164700815a58.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>As some of you may now, I'm very much a geek! Every geek for a very long time has dreamed of a day when they can walk in to the game, not just play it passively on a screen. Well that day has come, with the HTC Vive.... forget the Oculus Rift... The Vive is where it's at!</p>]]></description>
