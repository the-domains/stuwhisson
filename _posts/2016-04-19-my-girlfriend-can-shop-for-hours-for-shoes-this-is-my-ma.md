My girlfriend can shop for hours for shoes.... this is my Man version!

I've started using www.thegrid.io after signing up for the service perhaps nearly a year ago for $99\. Might actually have been a longer time than that. This is what I am using to build out the site. Apparently, it uses intelligent algorithms to analyse photos and text and content, to establish a means of presentation based on that content. Well, I've finally been given my beta access and of course all of this is early days and the algorithm is dynamic, but it seems ok (ish) so far. Hard to say and of course I've not really added a huge amount of content, but I do aim to at least add my ramblings and stuff as time goes on. My thinking really is that my music website www.stuwhisson.com is more primarily focused just on that, and on my degree. This open Diary, as the link from my site is named, is kinda like a diary. An open rambling stream of consciousness that could be of interest. Although, I do actually mean to make this somewhat interesting as a form of a resource, I will actually publish some of my degree papers here too. Obviously I have to do that after they have been assessed and marked, as otherwise their copyright system may flag up content that it may think I've copied from the Internet, which ironically would have come from my own site, but you know what these things are like.
