As some of you may now, I'm very much a geek! Every geek for a very long time has dreamed of a day when they can walk in to the game, not just play it passively on a screen. Well that day has come, with the HTC Vive.... forget the Oculus Rift... The Vive is where it's at!

I've been fortunate to be able to secure myself one of these and I am really looking forward to trying it out when I am back in the UK in May. I've not ever tried any of the VR systems, so it will be really interesting. I have set up another website a while ago, that focuses on the Google TiltBrush application and how people can draw 3D art and walk into it - www.tiltbrush.gallery go check it out. If you don't know what the fuss with HTC Vive is, go check it out here; www.htcvive.com
