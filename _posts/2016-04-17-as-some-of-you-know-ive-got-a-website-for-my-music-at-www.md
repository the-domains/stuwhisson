description: "As some of you know, I've got a website for my music at www.stuwhisson.com and that too has a blog, but I wanted to also create something that is perhaps a little different and a bit more dynamic. I'm not absolutely sure the whole purpose of what it would be, but I guess it would be more about not only my music, but my life, things I am doing, what I've been up to. I guess in some ways we can liken it to a very personal, direct social media page full of my ramblings and sometimes on the rare occasion something interesting too.\_"

As some of you know, I've got a website for my music at www.stuwhisson.com and that too has a blog, but I wanted to also create something that is perhaps a little different and a bit more dynamic. I'm not absolutely sure the whole purpose of what it would be, but I guess it would be more about not only my music, but my life, things I am doing, what I've been up to. I guess in some ways we can liken it to a very personal, direct social media page full of my ramblings and sometimes on the rare occasion something interesting too. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/270628bc-29b9-45b8-853f-c8a40d4d9214.jpg)
