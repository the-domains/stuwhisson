    description: 'The scene backstage last November at the American Music Awards, that annual gathering of pop perennials and idiosyncratic arrivistes, was carnivalesque: Niall and Liam of One Direction toddled about trying to snap a picture with a selfie stick, while Zayn, their bandmate at the time, smoked coolly out of frame; Ne-Yo was there in a leopard-Â­print blazer two sizes too small; Lil Wayne was wandering around, alone, wearing absurd shoes.'

description: "He passed away today at the age of 57 (Frank Micelotta/Getty Images) Something feels fundamentally wrong about imagining music without Prince: it's like a chill on the back of your neck, a taste in your mouth your body immediately begins to reject. If contemporary pop music is a tree, Prince's work is a huge chunk of its roots."
